# Simulation Code Structure

Sim_ES_fixedALL_S_upper_rand.m & EvidenceAccumulate_S_upper.m are the main files to perform evidence accumulation for the selected model

Afterwards, plotEmpiricalData_auto.m can be used to get summaries of the simulated draws and plot individually to see variance 

Afterwards, combined_plotEmpiricalData can be run to compare simulated to real data over all draws

garcia_replication_For_paper_21_posterior_draws.csv  -->  draws for the ESaDDM, no z
garcia_replication_For_paper_16_posterior_draws.csv  --> draws for the aDDM, no z
garcia_replication_For_paper_7_posterior_draws.csv   --> draws for the ESaDDM + z, a~OV
garcia_replication_For_paper_6_posterior_draws.csv   --> draws for the ESaDDM + z
garcia_replication_For_paper_2_posterior_draws.csv   --> draws for the aDDM + z
